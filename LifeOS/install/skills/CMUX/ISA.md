# ISA — CMUX skill

## Problem

LifeOS orchestrates agents three ways today — in-harness subagents (`Agent`/`Task`/`Workflow`), the remote Mac-mini fleet over SSH, and Kitty tab-state for at-a-glance status — but none give a single **programmatically-driveable, fully-visible cockpit** where every agent (LifeOS's own AND hands-on coding teams) can be seen, prompted, and steered at agent speed. Kitty tabs show state but can't be scripted into team layouts; subagents are black boxes you can't jump into mid-run; the fleet is SSH windows with no shared surface. The source video's thesis lands: *an agent you can't see is an agent you can't improve.* cmux (installed, `~/.local/bin/cmux`, v0.62.2) is a Mac-native terminal multiplexer with a real send/read/open-close control API — the missing cockpit — but nothing in LifeOS wraps it.

## Vision

`Skill("CMUX")` boots a named, color-identified cmux workspace of agents in one command — a 3-tier orchestrator→lead→worker team, an N-agent hotfix race, a 2×2 fleet, or the remote fleet — and {{DA_NAME}} drives them through the send/read loop, watches them via a poll-based monitor that fires {{DA_NAME}}'s voice on completion, and any agent can prompt any other agent flat. The video's whole feature set is native, our existing stack (Pulse, voice, Algorithm, memory, model routing) is intact underneath, and the Kitty terminal-watching layer has a clear, staged path to being replaced by cmux. Euphoric surprise: "I typed one command and watched a real team of agents light up, and {{DA_NAME}} told me out loud when they finished."

## Out of Scope

- Ripping out the working Kitty tab-state hooks THIS session (staged in DESIGN.md Phase 3 — never modify working features unprompted).
- Full Pulse SSE bridge for live cmux state (designed as Phase 2, stubbed not shipped).
- Linux/tmux fallback implementation (cmux is Mac-only; noted as a design risk, not built).
- Replacing Pulse, the voice server, the Algorithm, model routing, or the memory system (principal chose "replace terminal layer only").
- Building cmux itself or forking it.

## Principles

- **An agent you can't see is an agent you can't improve** — visibility is the point; every recipe leaves agents observable and jump-into-able.
- **Programmatic access = agent speed** — every capability is a scriptable subcommand, not a GUI click.
- **Wrap, don't reinvent** — build on cmux's real CLI and (if present) `claude-teams`; the wrapper stays thin.
- **Public-clean by construction** — no private identity/hosts in the shipped skill; private specifics live in USER config.
- **Poll, don't pretend** — cmux exposes no event stream; the monitor honestly polls, and says so.

## Constraints

- Bun-always, TypeScript-always. No `just` (recipes are bun subcommands).
- cmux is a Mac GUI app; socket exists only while running; wrapper must auto-launch.
- Socket auth via `CMUX_SOCKET_PASSWORD`/`--password`/Settings.
- Public skill (`TitleCase`): zero real hosts/IPs/identity; `~/` not absolute user home paths.
- Voice endpoint is `localhost:31337/notify`; Pulse/Algorithm/memory contracts unchanged.
- Never modify working features unprompted — Kitty hooks stay live until an explicit cutover.

## Dependencies

- requires: voice-server — `POST localhost:31337/notify {message,voice_enabled}` reachable
- requires: cmux-binary — `~/.local/bin/cmux` v0.62.x with the documented command surface
- requires: fleet-config — the CMUX USER customization dir holds `fleet.json` (optional; mini-fleet degrades to `--hosts`)

## Goal

"switch to CMUX and implement all of our cool features, plus all the features that he talks about, into a new upgraded CMUX experience." Concretely: ship a public `CMUX` skill whose `Tools/cmux.ts` wrapper drives the real cmux via the send/read/open-close loop; provide recipes for 3-tier teams, agent-races, named fleets, and the remote mini-fleet; wire completion → {{DA_NAME}} voice; keep Pulse/voice/Algorithm/memory intact; and deliver a migration DESIGN.md that maps every video feature AND every LifeOS feature into the cockpit with a staged Kitty→cmux replacement. Verified by actually driving a live cmux workspace.

## Criteria

- [ ] ISC-1: `skills/CMUX/Tools/cmux.ts` exists and `bun cmux.ts --help` prints usage, exit 0
- [ ] ISC-2: `cmux.ts` type-checks clean (`bun build --target bun` or `tsc --noEmit`, zero errors)
- [ ] ISC-3: `cmuxExec` auto-launches the app on "Socket not found" then retries (code path present + proven by a live cold-start)
- [ ] ISC-4: `send --surface <ref> "<t>" --enter` types text AND submits (Enter) — round-tripped via `read`
- [ ] ISC-5: `read --surface <ref>` returns screen text as `{ok,text}` from a live surface
- [ ] ISC-6: `boot-team --name --tiers` creates a live workspace with a lead pane + worker column, returns surface refs
- [ ] ISC-7: `race --feature --agents N` opens N labeled surfaces in one workspace
- [ ] ISC-8: `fleet --name --grid 2x2` creates a live 2×2 grid
- [ ] ISC-9: `mini-fleet` reads fleet config (or --hosts) and opens one SSH pane per host; NO hardcoded hosts in the file
- [ ] ISC-10: `monitor --once` polls surface-health + read-screen and classifies each surface idle|working|done|awaiting-input
- [ ] ISC-11: `monitor` fires `notifyVoice` (POST /notify) on transition to done/awaiting — verified by a voice-event
- [ ] ISC-12: `flash --workspace <ref>` triggers a visible flash on a live workspace
- [ ] ISC-13: `voice "<msg>"` POSTs to localhost:31337/notify and returns ok
- [ ] ISC-14: `list`/`tree` returns parsed JSON topology of a live cmux instance
- [ ] ISC-15: Flat comms — one agent surface can `cmux send` a prompt to another surface, proven by read-back
- [ ] ISC-16: `SKILL.md` present with valid frontmatter (name CMUX, description with USE WHEN + NOT FOR), routing table, Gotchas, Examples
- [ ] ISC-17: Four Workflows exist: BootTeam.md, AgentRace.md, Fleet.md, Monitor.md
- [ ] ISC-18: `DESIGN.md` maps all 10 video features → wrapper mechanism + status
- [ ] ISC-19: `DESIGN.md` maps all LifeOS features (Pulse, voice, Algorithm, routing, fleet, memory, Kitty) → keep/replace/bridge
- [ ] ISC-20: `DESIGN.md` specifies the staged Kitty→cmux terminal-layer replacement with reversibility per phase
- [ ] ISC-21: Public-clean — the release identity/host deny-list grep over `skills/CMUX/` returns zero matches
- [ ] ISC-22: Anti: the skill does NOT edit/remove any Kitty tab-state hook this session (working features untouched)
- [ ] ISC-23: Anti: no recipe hardcodes a private host/IP/credential
- [ ] ISC-24: Anti: `send` without `--enter` never silently claims the prompt ran (must require Enter to submit)
- [ ] ISC-25: Antecedent: a live cmux instance is running (auto-launched) before any live-driving ISC is probed
- [ ] ISC-26: Live end-to-end — one real recipe (boot-team or fleet) is driven against live cmux and screenshot/tree-verified
- [ ] ISC-27: Advisor consulted before `phase: complete`; verdict recorded
- [ ] ISC-28: Forge audit-mode pass (E5 cross-vendor) run in VERIFY; verdict recorded

## Decisions

- D-1: E5 interview fired (mandatory). Answers: BUILD it · UNIFIED (LifeOS agents + hands-on teams) · REPLACE terminal layer only (Pulse/voice/Algorithm/memory stay).
- D-2: Direct parallel agents over a full Workflow — build has a sequential spine (scaffold→fill→live-verify) and live cmux GUI driving must stay in the main loop. Delegation floor ≥4 met (Forge build + 2 general-purpose + CodexResearcher).
- D-3: Kitty→cmux hook cutover STAGED, not done this session — ripping out working hooks unprompted violates "never modify working features." DESIGN.md Phase 3.
- D-4: Public skill → fleet hosts read from USER config, never hardcoded. Socket password from env.
- D-5: `model:fable` on Agent dispatch currently executes Opus (logged harness downgrade) — E5 delegates run Opus in fact; Forge/CodexResearcher run their own vendor.
- D-6: PLAN-REFRESH (CodexResearcher). cmux is PUSH-native via `cmux claude-teams` (auto-injects Claude Code lifecycle hooks → `cmux claude-hook <event>`) + `set-hook`/`wait-for`/`pipe-pane`/OSC. Monitor must prefer hook-push; polling is fallback. Contract's "poll-not-event" was wrong — wrapper `monitor` needs reconcile.
- D-7: PLAN-REFRESH. Socket is DEFAULT-DENY ("only processes started inside cmux can connect"). Wrapper's "auto-launch then drive from outside" fails without auth. Two supported paths: run orchestrator INSIDE a cmux surface (inherits `CMUX_SOCKET_PATH`), or set a Settings socket password → `CMUX_SOCKET_PASSWORD`. Wrapper must detect the auth wall and surface it, not silent-fail. ISC-3 auto-launch is necessary-but-insufficient; add auth-mode handling.
- D-8: Build ON `cmux claude-teams` (it IS Claude Code + session tracking) rather than reinventing a status poller. Pulse bridge = read session JSON (`report_meta`/`set-status`/`set-progress`/`log` → sidebar, persisted, readable WITHOUT socket). cmux is OSS github.com/manaflow-ai/cmux, GPL-3.0, Ghostty-based, macOS-only.

## Changelog

- conjectured: cmux exposes no event stream, so monitoring must poll `surface-health`+`read-screen` (written into CONTRACT + first SKILL.md gotcha).
- refuted_by: CodexResearcher local-verified `cmux claude-teams` hook injection + `set-hook`/`wait-for`/`pipe-pane`/OSC push mechanisms; the `claude` shim wires SessionStart/Stop/Notification → `cmux claude-hook`.
- learned: cmux is push-native and default-deny on the socket; the clean LifeOS integration runs agents via `claude-teams` inside a surface (inherited auth) and mirrors state to Pulse by reading the session JSON — no polling, no auth wall.
- criterion_now: SKILL.md gotchas corrected (push-native + default-deny + no-auth sidebar-JSON bridge); wrapper `monitor` + auth handling pending reconcile against the Forge build.
