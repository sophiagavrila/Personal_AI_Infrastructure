/**
 * ============================================================================
 * MODELS — single source of truth for model IDs across LifeOS
 * ============================================================================
 *
 * WHY THIS EXISTS:
 * Model IDs used to be pinned in scattered files. On a new model release the
 * updates were a manual scramble and drifted silently (e.g. ContextAudit
 * checked for claude-opus-4-7 long after claude-opus-4-8 shipped). This file
 * is the one place that knows current IDs. Consumers either:
 *   (a) use a tier ALIAS ("opus"/"sonnet"/"haiku") — auto-resolves to latest,
 *       no registry needed (preferred — see Pulse manifests, Inference.ts), or
 *   (b) import CURRENT[...] from here when they genuinely need a pinned ID
 *       (e.g. a drift-check that must name the expected latest).
 *
 * ON A NEW RELEASE: bump CURRENT below (one edit), then `bun UpdateModels.ts
 * --check` confirms nothing else drifted. The _NEWS Anthropic monitor surfaces
 * a proposal when it detects a new model; application is propose-not-auto.
 *
 * NOT IN SCOPE: cross-vendor pins (Forge gpt-5.5, build+audit modes) track their own
 * vendors — recorded here for inventory, never auto-bumped to Claude.
 * ============================================================================

/**
 * ============================================================================
 * EFFORT LEVELS — the four-level abstraction over the Claude lineup

 * Consumers route by INTENT (max/high/medium/low), never by model name. Two
 * independent edit points keep the system cohesive across model churn:
 *
 *   Layer 1  EFFORT_MODEL  level → tier   edit when the LINEUP changes
 *                                          (a model enters/exits the
 *                                          subscription, or moves rungs)
 *   Layer 2  CURRENT       tier → ID      edit when a VERSION releases
 *
 * Routing policy (Algorithm doctrine): NATIVE delegated work runs at `high`;
 * Algorithm E1–E3 dispatch at `high`; E4/E5 dispatch at `max`. `medium` and
 * `low` exist for utility inference (classification, summarization, vision
 * triage) so cheap calls never silently ride an expensive model. The
 * Advisor is pinned `max` (keystone commitment call); the EffortRouter
 * classifier is pinned `high` (Opus, re-pinned off `max` 2026-07-01) — it
 * fires on every prompt, so the per-prompt keystone stays off the top rung.

/**
 * Level → tier binding. THIS IS THE SINGLE EDIT POINT on a lineup change.
 * Example: Fable exits the subscription → `max: "opus"` and the entire
 * routing system follows; no other code changes.
 *
 * DECISION (2026-07-01, principal): Fable is re-enabled and IS the top rung.
 * `max: "fable"` — the hardest work (Algorithm E4/E5 + every Core-System
 * Override task) auto-dispatches Fable; `high` stays Opus for E1–E3 + NATIVE.
 * This restores a real ladder to the routing system — Fable → Opus → Sonnet →
 * Haiku — reachable with NO new agent (the dispatch-time `model` param carries
 * the rung; agents are personas, model is orthogonal). Fable is ~2× Opus, so
 * the cost lands only on genuinely hard runs. Two guardrails ship with the flip:
 *   (a) the EffortRouter classifier is re-pinned to `high` (Opus), NOT `max`,
 *       so the per-prompt keystone stays fast + cheap — "keystone" never meant
 *       "most-expensive rung"; the classifier's model is UNCHANGED from before
 *       the flip (it was Opus via max=opus; it's Opus via high now).
 *   (b) the Advisor stays at `max` (now Fable) — a once-per-deliverable
 *       commitment call, where best judgment is worth the cost.
 * `max` and `high` are now DISTINCT models, so the Inference.ts max-fallback
 * degrades max→high = fable→opus: a genuinely real degraded path.
 *
 * SUPERSEDES the 2026-06-30 decision ("Opus stays top, Fable no longer the
 * intended top model"). That call held while Fable was unavailable; Fable is
 * reachable again (probed 2026-07-01: `claude --model fable` → clean completion)
 * and the principal's directive is that the hardest work should ride it. The
 * prior decision is preserved here in history, not tombstoned.

/**
 * ============================================================================
 * THE THREE LEVEL AXES — don't conflate them (2026-06-29)
 * ============================================================================
 * LifeOS has three independent "level" dials. They share words ("max", "high")
 * but they are NOT one axis. The statusline shows two of them; this file is the
 * source of truth for the mapping between the first two.
 *
 *   1. MODEL RUNG       EFFORT_MODEL above — which Claude model an agent runs.
 *                       Exactly four, because the lineup has four models
 *                       (fable/opus/sonnet/haiku): max | high | medium | low.
 *
 *   2. REASONING EFFORT HarnessEffort — how hard a model thinks WITHIN itself
 *                       (Claude Code's `--effort` / `/effort` knob). Five:
 *                       low | medium | high | xhigh | max. This is the LEVEL the
 *                       statusline reads from `effort.level`. Claude-Code-owned:
 *                       a UserPromptSubmit hook can read it but CANNOT set the main
 *                       loop's value (hooks doc "Important Limitations") — it's
 *                       `/effort` / settings `effortLevel` / `--effort` /
 *                       `CLAUDE_CODE_EFFORT_LEVEL` only, and the persistent field
 *                       caps at `xhigh` (`max` is `/effort max` interactive-only).
 *                       Only dispatched agents carry a programmable effort
 *                       (Algorithm v6.19.0 § tier table). Because the tier can't
 *                       auto-apply its target, the statusline SURFACES the gap:
 *                       when live effort is below the active Algorithm tier's
 *                       target (E1 low · E2 medium · E3 high · E4 xhigh · E5 xhigh
 *                       — xhigh not max at E5: the nudge only points at a settable
 *                       level; `max` is `/effort max` interactive-only),
 *                       it renders an amber `↑<TARGET>` nudge — the un-settable
 *                       dial made visible, one `/effort` to close it. See
 *                       LIFEOS_StatusLine.sh § "Effort↔tier nudge" (2026-06-29).
 *
 *   3. COMPOSITION      ultracode — whether to fan a task into a multi-agent
 *                       Workflow. NOT an effort level: it rides on xhigh effort
 *                       and is detected via output-style, not `effort.level`
 *                       (LIFEOS_StatusLine.sh promotes XHIGH→ULT). It belongs to
 *                       no rung; it is orthogonal to axes 1 and 2.
 *
 * The crossover that trips people up: dispatching at MODEL RUNG `max` emits
 * REASONING EFFORT `xhigh`, NOT `max` (see LEVEL_TO_HARNESS_EFFORT). "Max model"
 * and "max thinking" are different dials that share a word. LifeOS dispatch
 * deliberately caps reasoning at `xhigh`; harness effort `max` is reachable by a
 * human via `/effort max` but no LifeOS level emits it.
