# OPERATIONAL_RULES.md — Your principal-specific operational rules

> Principal-bound operational rules, imported into context every session. The system prompt (`PAI/LIFEOS_SYSTEM_PROMPT.md`) carries the domain-agnostic rules everyone runs; this file is where YOUR specifics live — your tooling choices, your environment, your vendor-specific gotchas, conventions for your own repos.

This file ships as a stub. Add rules as you discover them — the LifeOS `/interview` flow will help, or just write them here directly. A few starter categories:

## Tool & environment preferences

- _(e.g. "always use `bun`, never `npm`"; your canonical `.env` path; preferred CLI tools)_

## Repo conventions

- _(e.g. which repos commit straight to `main` vs use branches/PRs)_

## Deployment

- _(e.g. what "ship it" means for each project — deploy, push, both)_

## Vendor-specific rules

- _(e.g. how you verify a cloud API token; rotation playbooks; known false-negative probes)_

---
*Keep each rule concrete and sourced to the moment you learned it. The most useful entries are the ones that encode a mistake you don't want to repeat.*
