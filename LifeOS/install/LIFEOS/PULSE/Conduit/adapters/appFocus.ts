/**
 * app-focus adapter — the foreground application at poll time.
 *
 * Uses `osascript` via execFile (argument array, never a shell string — no
 * interpolation, per the security protocol). Captures the app NAME only, no window
 * title (window titles need Screen Recording permission; deferred to v1.1). Cheap:
 * one ~50ms osascript call per poll. Never throws — returns [] on any failure.
 *
 * macOS ONLY, and it says so now. `osascript` does not exist off macOS, so on any
 * other platform every poll used to fall into the bare `catch` and return [] with no
 * log line. That hides the gap indefinitely: capture reports ok, events accumulate,
 * and the whole time model silently reads zero, because rollup derives every minute
 * from app-focus. A failure this total must be audible, so the reason is logged ONCE
 * per process — never is wrong, and every poll would drown the log.
 *
 * There is no drop-in replacement on Wayland: an unprivileged process cannot ask
 * which window has focus. GNOME's org.gnome.Shell.Introspect.GetWindows answers
 * AccessDenied, and xprop sees only XWayland clients, so it would report confidently
 * wrong apps for native ones. A Shell extension exposing focus over D-Bus is the
 * real port. Until then rollup.ts falls back to session-derived time.
 * ported from public PR #1788, @pkumaschow
