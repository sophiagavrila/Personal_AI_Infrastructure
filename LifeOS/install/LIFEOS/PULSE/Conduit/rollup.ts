/**
 * Deterministic daily rollup. PURE: buildDailyRecord takes events + poll interval and
 * returns a DailyRecord with zero side effects and zero model calls — which is what
 * makes v1 stable and testable. Persistence is a separate function.
 *
 * Time model: each app-focus event represents one poll interval of that app (capped —
 * a sleep gap does not inflate time because launchd fires no polls while asleep).
 *
 * FALLBACK: app-focus needs macOS `osascript`, so on every other platform it yields
 * nothing and the whole time model reads zero while capture reports healthy. When a
 * day has no focus time, time is derived from claude-session cadence instead — the
 * signal that IS present everywhere. It is labelled as derived in the block itself,
 * because inferred keyboard time and measured focus time are not the same claim and
 * the record should not blur them.
 * ported from public PR #1788, @pkumaschow

 * the real spacing is irregular and always ≥ the scheduler's interval. A hardcoded cap
 * would silently undercount the moment that interval changed.
 *
 * Each event is credited with the gap BACK to the previous one — N events yield N-1
