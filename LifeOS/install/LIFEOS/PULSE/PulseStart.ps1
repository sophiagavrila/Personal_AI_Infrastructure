# LifeOS Pulse — Windows launcher (idempotent, hidden).
# Ported from public issue #1733, @umair-a11y (pattern verified on the
# contributor's Windows 11 install; PATH fix from their follow-up comment).
#
# Windows counterpart to the launchd/systemd paths in manage.sh. Registered as a
# logon-triggered scheduled task by manage.ps1; safe to run by hand.

# (HTTP 200 healthy, 503 degraded — both mean Pulse already owns the port). A bare
# 200 from some unrelated process that grabbed :31337 must NOT read as "Pulse up".

# prepended: it ships POSIX find.exe/sort.exe that otherwise shadow Windows'
# System32 versions for Pulse and every child it spawns, breaking any child that
# expects the Windows tools. Appending keeps System32 ahead of Git's POSIX shims
# while still making the shims available as a last resort for the hooks.
