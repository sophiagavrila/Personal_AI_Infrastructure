/**
 * Typecheck.ts — `bun build` does not typecheck. This does.
 *
 * WHY IT EXISTS. Bun bundles without checking types, so a field that is read but
 * never declared bundles cleanly and therefore "compiles". The build was answering
 * a weaker question than the one we thought we were asking, and code stayed broken
 * for days while every signal stayed green.
 *
 * TWO PASSES, NOT ONE:
 *   1. root   — hooks/ + LIFEOS/TOOLS/
 *   2. Pulse  — LIFEOS/PULSE/**
 *
 * They are two passes rather than one wider `include` because Pulse has its own
 * dependencies and its own node_modules; folding it into the root pass makes both
 * resolve against the wrong tree.
 *
 * THE CONFIGS ARE GENERATED AND THROWN AWAY, ON PURPOSE. A file literally named
 * `tsconfig.json` at the install root would be read by BUN AT RUNTIME for module
 * resolution: a single `paths` / `baseUrl` / `jsx` field in it would silently move
 * the behaviour of every live hook and of the running Pulse server. Writing the
 * configs under a non-standard name, and deleting them at the end, makes runtime
 * invariance true BY CONSTRUCTION rather than by discipline — only `tsc -p` ever
 * opens them.
 *
 * THE TOMBSTONE IS LOUD ON PURPOSE. A silent exclusion is a false green with a UI:
 * after a while nobody remembers that some code is not being looked at, and "the
 * typecheck passes" starts to mean less than it appears to. Every run says it out
 * loud. Excluded does not mean healthy — it means NOT LOOKED AT.
 *
 * USAGE  bun LIFEOS/TOOLS/Typecheck.ts
 * EXIT   0 = both passes clean · 1 = at least one pass has type errors

 * Decide the `types` entry by asking the repo, not by guessing a package name.

 * A hardcoded `types: ["bun"]` is a promise the install may not be able to keep: naming a
 * type package that is not installed under ROOT is a HARD failure (TS2688, "Cannot find type
 * definition file"), and the name that happens to work here resolved out of a node_modules
 * ABOVE ROOT — an accident of this machine, not a property of the install.
 *
 * So: copy whatever ROOT/tsconfig.json already declares, but only when those packages are
 * actually installed under ROOT. Otherwise omit `types` entirely, which degrades to tsc's
 * default @types discovery instead of erroring out, and say so out loud — an unchecked
 * global surface that nobody is told about is the same false green the tombstone exists for.
