/**
 * PurgeArchives.ts — delete expired archived versions inside an archive directory.
 *
 * POLICY. A manual archive is a grace window, not forever. A file older than N days
 * (default 14) is deleted, UNLESS its name starts with `KEEP-`, which is an explicit
 * "hold this" signal. Silence means it goes after N days; `KEEP-` means it stays.
 * The trigger is lazy: call it right after archiving a new version by hand, so the
 * directory prunes itself as a side effect of being used, with no scheduler.
 *
 * FAIL-CLOSED DIRECTORY GUARD — this is the part that makes it safe to point at
 * anything. It refuses any directory whose basename is not exactly the sentinel
 * (`_archive` by default, `--dir-name` to change it). A tool that deletes by age
 * is one bad argument away from deleting live work, so the guard is not "check the
 * path looks plausible": the directory has to be NAMED as an archive, which is a
 * property no working directory acquires by accident.
 *
 * It also only ever deletes FILES (never subdirectories), skips dotfiles, logs every
 * action, and touches nothing at all under `--dry-run`.
 *
 * USAGE  bun LIFEOS/TOOLS/PurgeArchives.ts <dir> [--days N] [--dir-name NAME] [--dry-run]
 * EXIT   0 = ok (including when nothing was deleted) · 1 = usage error or guard refusal
